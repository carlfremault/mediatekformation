# PHP / Symfony web application - Mediatek Formations
School project for my BTS SIO courses at CNED (therefore comments are in french)

For this project I made the requested additions to an existing web application

- adding a table in the database for course levels, show course levels on the different front office pages
- adding a back office allowing to add, modify and delete courses and levels
- OAuth SSO authentification using Keycloak (running on a Azure Virtual Machine)
- Continuous Delivery with GitHub Workflow
